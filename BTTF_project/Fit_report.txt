Explanation of Parameters:

From the Activation energy function, I was convinced that all parameters has 
a unit of eV per volt including cap.

1eV/v=1.6e-19C/v

Therefore, 1.27eV/v=[(1.27eV/v)/(1eV/v)] x 1.6e-19C/v
                   = 2.03e-19C/v ,but C/v=F
                   
Therefore, 2.03e-19C/v=2.03e-19F 
In the BTTF work, you had 1.31e-19F. I initially tried to use such value for cap and it did not work. I noticed i could get close by using the above conversions. Also, was convinced that 2.03e-19F is right although bigger than 1.31e-19F. This was based on Figure24c was your work, and the fitting in your case was done for only half of the entire figure. So, i am convinced that, if we are to do the fitting for the entire figure, we shall be moving from 1.31e-19F to 2.03e-19F.

All other parameters conform to the values you had for Figure24C of the BTTF work. I use the same logic to work on the current Fc-OPEn & OPEnC .
